About
=====

This is a library implementing skip lists for the Go programming
language (http://golang.org/).

Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of
balanced trees. Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than
strictly enforced balancing and as a result the algorithms for
insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and
significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.

Skip lists were first described in
[Pugh, William (June 1990)](ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/skipLists/skiplists.pdf). "Skip
lists: a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees". Communications
of the ACM 33 (6): 668â€“676
